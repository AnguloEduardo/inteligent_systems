This mini proyect tackles the traditional Cannibals and Missionaries problem, on which the player needs to pass all the cannibals and missionaries from one edge of a revier to the other edge without leaving more cannibals than missionaries on each edge. To get the minimum movements to win the game, we have implemented two different searches: Breath First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) to find all the possible moves and calculate the path that will lead to the winning of the game. Using both types of searches, we found out that for 3 cannibals and for 3 missionaries this two types of seraches give the same result but we think that if there were more cannibals and missionaries there would be a difference between the two searches.
